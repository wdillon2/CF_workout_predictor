Capstone Project - Building a Workout Predictor

Predicting athlete performance on any given workout based on previous workout performances.

By analyzing performance of athletes across broad time and modal domains I would hope to make a prediction how well an athlete would perform on any given workout.

This information could be used as a predictive model to see who might win in a crossfit competition.

It could also be used to enhance workout apps that track your workout scores.  The app beyond the whiteboard could use it to inform a client how long a certain workout should take, or give them a suggestion so they have a goal in mind.
